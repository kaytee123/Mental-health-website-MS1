The live website can be found [here](https://github.com/kaytee123/Mental-health-website-MS1)

## Purpose

This Website was created for the sole purpose of completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. It was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS, User Centric Design, Bootstrap and Interactive Frontend Development modules. This website was built to help 
people who are battling mental health problems seek help and has linked videos to a valid source.

Site Goals:
* To showcase the skills I have learnt in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
* To provide users information about mental health.
* To create awareness about the impact mental health could have on an individual.
* To help people seek help and know they are not alone.


-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are purple, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

#### User stories

* As a user, I want to view the website and content clearly on any device.
* As a user, I want to know if information provided are true .

```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.


  #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

        1. These are clearly shown in the banner message.
        2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.

        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the organization's email.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
